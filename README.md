This is My First Project in Development Economics Course in TeIAS. In this project, I investigate the effect of indutstrial policy on Clothing industry. 
Using Dif in Dif Methodology and Leather industry as control group I have tried to answer to this question that weather the exchange rate fluctuations has effects on clothing industry procution or not. 
Main datasets are firstly the flie all.xlsx which is the main data source of workshops of different industries. the second main dataset is inflation which is used to adjust real vlues. 
The last dataset is year-exchange-rates-filtered which shows the fluctuations in exchagne rate in Iran.
